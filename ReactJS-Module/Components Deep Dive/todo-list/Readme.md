## Features

The TODO App is designed to help you manage tasks efficiently. Here are its key features:

1. **Task List**: Easily view and manage your tasks in a well-organized list.
2. **Toggle Status**: Toggle the completion status of tasks between "Complete" and "Not Complete".
3. **Add New Task**: Add new tasks to your list.
4. **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need from the list.

## What I Learned

While developing the TODO App, I gained insights into various aspects of React and web development, including:

- **Component Structure**: How to design a modular component-based structure for building user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Implementing state management using React's `useState` hook for dynamic updates.
- **API Interaction**: Interacting with APIs to fetch and update data using the `fetch` function.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Handling asynchronous operations like data fetching and updates using `async/await`.
- **`useEffect` Hook**: Improving my understanding of how the `useEffect` hook operates, enabling me to effectively manage side effects and dynamic behavior within React components.
## How to Use

Using the TODO App is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

2. **Starting the App**:
   - After installation, run `npm start` to start the development server.
     
3. **Using the Practice Server**:
   - In a separate terminal window, navigate to the provided `server` folder.
   - Run `node server.js` to start the practice server.
   - The server will run on `http://localhost:3030`.
   - For more details about setting up and using the practice server, please refer to the [README.md](./server/readme.md) file located in the `server` folder.
