### Module 1: JavaScript Advanced

During this module, I gained advanced knowledge of JavaScript that includes:

- Functions: advanced concepts like higher-order functions, recursion, and closures.
- Objects: how to work with objects, prototypes, and inheritance in JavaScript.
- Asynchronous Programming: how to use promises, async/await, and other techniques to manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Through this module, I have learned how to build more complex and scalable applications in JavaScript. I am confident in my ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient JavaScript code.

### Module 2: JavaScript Application

During this module, I applied my knowledge of JavaScript to build a complete web application. I used HTML and CSS provided by SoftUni University to create the user interface and wrote JavaScript code to add the functionality.

I learned how to:

1. Work with the DOM: how to access and manipulate elements on a web page using JavaScript.
2. Handle user input: how to respond to user input and events using event listeners.
3. Make HTTP requests: how to use the Fetch API to communicate with web servers and APIs.
4. Build a single-page application: how to use JavaScript to create a smooth and interactive user experience.

This module has given me a strong understanding of how to build complete web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am confident in my ability to apply these skills to build my own web projects.
