## About

In this repository, you will find organized folders for each module in the JavaScript path of the SoftUni curriculum. Each module folder contains lecture notes, practical exercises, and projects that demonstrate my understanding and application of JavaScript concepts.

## Modules

The JavaScript path consists of four modules:

1. Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript
2. Module 2: JavaScript Advanced
3. Module 3: JavaScript Applications
4. Module 4: JavaScript Back-End

Inside each module folder, you will find subfolders for specific topics covered within that module. These subfolders will contain lecture materials, exercises, and projects corresponding to the respective topics.

## Technologies

Throughout the JavaScript path, I have worked with the following technologies and tools:

- Programming Language: JavaScript
- Testing Frameworks: Mocha, Chai
- Web Automation: PlayWright
- Front-End Framework: page.js, lit-html

Please note that the technologies mentioned above are specific to the JavaScript path. Additional technologies and tools may be included depending on the exercises and projects within each module.
