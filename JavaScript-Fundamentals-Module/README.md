# JavaScript-Fundamentals 
!__! Hello, I already finished all the tasks in the 'Fundamentals module' but didn't know how to use 'GitHub' at this moment. Now I know how to use it and all of the tasks will be uploaded at the same time.ðŸ˜…

### What I learned from this module: 

  - Handling standard programming language functionality.
  - Working with linear data structures.
  - Basic HTML and CSS skills.
  - Improving problem-solving skills.
  - Working with objects, arrays, and functions and learning new skills with them.
